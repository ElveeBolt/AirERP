This Django-based project is an Airline Booking and Management System designed to streamline the airline booking process and provide efficient management of flights and related services. The system is designed to accommodate three user roles: Gate Agents, Supervisors, and Check-in Managers, each with their specific responsibilities and access levels.


### User Roles:
**Gate Agents:** Gate Agents are responsible for handling passenger check-ins, boarding procedures, and resolving customer queries at the airport gates. They have access to passenger information and flight details.

**Supervisors:** Supervisors have a broader view of the operations. They can monitor multiple flights, check flight schedules, and oversee the work of gate agents. They also have the authority to make important decisions regarding flight management.

**Check-in Managers:** Check-in Managers focus on managing passenger check-in processes and ensuring a smooth transition from check-in to boarding. They have access to passenger data and can assist passengers with various check-in-related tasks.

### Flight Booking:
Passengers can easily search for available flights, view flight details, and book tickets through a user-friendly interface.

### Additional Services:
For each flight, passengers can opt for additional services such as in-flight meals, extra legroom seats, or priority boarding, enhancing their travel experience.

### Baggage Management:
Passengers can manage their baggage, including checking the weight and size restrictions, as well as paying for excess baggage.

### Admin Panel:
Administrators can manage user accounts, view booking histories, and oversee the overall system operation.
